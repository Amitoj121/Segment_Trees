# Segment_Trees
The following project implements segment trees in c++. As of now various operations have been performed like finding max,min,or and and of elements in a given range,further updates will be made in due time.
<br>
The update function has been added to the code as well for updating values in the array.
<br>
Further Update includes calculating sum for given range and also range updates (Ony for Sum Calculation). It does not modify the given array neither it has any effect on other functions,it is only used for range sum queries using lazy propagation algorithm.
