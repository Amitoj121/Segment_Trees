# Segment_Trees
This repository contains an implementation of a Segment Tree in C++. The Segment Tree is a versatile data structure that supports efficient range queries and updates. This implementation includes operations such as finding the maximum, minimum, bitwise OR, bitwise AND, and sum within a range, along with support for lazy propagation for range updates.

Files
1. Segment_Tree.h
This is the header file that contains the declaration of the Segment_Tree class and its member functions.
<br>
2. Segment_Tree.cpp
This file contains the definitions of the member functions declared in Segment_Tree.h. It includes the constructor and functions for building the tree, querying range values, and updating the tree.
<br>
3. test_case.cpp
This file contains the main function to test the Segment Tree. It includes interactive input for the user to perform various operations on the Segment Tree, such as:

Calculating the maximum in a given range.
Calculating the minimum in a given range.
Calculating the bitwise OR in a given range.
Calculating the bitwise AND in a given range.
Updating a value in the array.
Calculating the sum in a given range.
Performing range updates (only for sum calculation).
<br>
Compilation and Execution
<br>
To compile and Run the code,use following commands:
<br>
g++ -o test_case Segment_Tree.cpp test_case.cpp
<br> 
Run The Executable:
<br>
./test_case
<br>
Usage
When you run the test_case executable, you will be prompted to enter the size of the array and its elements. After building the Segment Tree, you can interactively perform the following operations:

Calculate the maximum in a given range.
Calculate the minimum in a given range.
Calculate the bitwise OR in a given range.
Calculate the bitwise AND in a given range.
Update a value in the array.
Calculate the sum in a given range.
Perform a range update (only affects the sum calculation).

Real-Life Applications of Segment Trees
<br>
Segment Trees are powerful and flexible data structures used in numerous real-world scenarios requiring efficient range queries and updates. Some key applications include:
<br>
1. Database Management Systems
Segment Trees facilitate fast range queries and updates, making them ideal for database management systems with frequent large dataset interactions. They enable quick retrieval of aggregated data over ranges, such as sums, maximums, minimums, and other statistical measures.
<br>
2. Image Processing
In image processing, Segment Trees can perform range queries on pixel values, like finding the maximum or minimum intensity in an image subregion. They are also employed in algorithms for image segmentation, filtering, and enhancement.
<br>
3. Computer Graphics
Segment Trees are useful in computer graphics for operations such as clipping, where determining the visibility of objects within a specified range is necessary. They efficiently manage updates and queries on graphical objects.
<br>
4. Network Traffic Analysis
Segment Trees help monitor and analyze network traffic over time by aggregating data over various intervals. They assist in calculating total data transmitted, identifying peak usage times, and detecting anomalies.
<br>
5. Financial Analysis
Segment Trees are utilized in financial analysis to quickly compute aggregated values over a range of data points, like stock prices and trading volumes. They support efficient range queries for various statistical measures, aiding analysts in making informed decisions.
